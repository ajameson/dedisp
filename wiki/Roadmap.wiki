Please bear in mind that the author(s) may never get around to implementing anything listed on this page!


= Potential Future Features =

  * Support for asynchronous execution and memory copies via CUDA streams.
  * Support for time-scrunching at large DMs.
  * A CPU back-end to complement the current GPU one, and the ability to switch between them.
  * Support for sub-band/tree dedispersion for improved performance (at a user-defined max loss of SNR).
  * An OpenCL back-end for use on a broader range of hardware.
