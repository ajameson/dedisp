= Introduction =
dedisp provides a simple C interface to computing dedispersion transforms using a GPU. The interface is modelled on that of the well-known [http://www.fftw.org/ FFTW] library, and uses an object-oriented approach. The user first creates a dedispersion _plan_, and then calls functions to modify or execute that plan. A full list and description of the functions provided by the library can be viewed in the API documentation below.
