============
INSTALLATION
============
1) Modify the entries in Makefile.inc to suit your system.
2) Run make.
If all goes well, the library will be built in ./lib and the header
in ./include. If something goes wrong, please let me know either via
email or the project website.

=========
DEBUGGING
=========
The following make flag can be used to build the library in a debug
mode, which will print the location and description of errors as they
happen:
$ make DEDISP_DEBUG=1
